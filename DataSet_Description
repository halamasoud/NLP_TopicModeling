Dataset description :
In the Age of the Internet we humans as a species have become increasingly connected with each other. Unfortunately, that's not always a good thing. Sometimes we end up inadvertently connecting with people we'd really rather not talk to at all and it ruins our day.
In fact, trolls abound on the internet and its become increasingly difficult to find quality online discussions.Many online publishers simply do not allow commenting because of how easy it is for a few trolls to derail an otherwise illuminating discussion.
But maybe we can fix all that with the power of data science.
